# Group 11 Project 1-SoFloFood

## Description

The primary goal of this project was to develop an app that assists users in finding the ideal dining experience based on the ambiance and cuisine type, whether they are tourists exploring a new city or locals seeking fresh places to dine. Essentially, it's like providing a solution to the timeless question, "where should we eat?"

We encountered various challenges throughout the journey, mainly because none of us had any prior coding experience. Nevertheless, as we progressed, we were able to enhance our critical thinking skills, foster better teamwork, and grasp new knowledge from our Boot Camp experience. While acknowledging that there's still much more to learn, maintaining an open and receptive approach to learning will undoubtedly be a key factor in achieving our goals and success.
